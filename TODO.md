# TODO: Fix Form Styling and Categories in berita_list_owner.html

## Tasks
- [x] Update select options in the kategori field to match the model choices: Futsal, Basket, Badminton, Tenis, Padel, Komunitas, Tips Olahraga.
- [x] Add hover effects to form fields (inputs, textarea, select) for better user experience, e.g., hover:border-gray-400.
- [x] Ensure borders are present and consistent across all form elements.
- [ ] Test the modal form to verify styling and functionality.

## Notes
- The template now uses manual HTML for form fields instead of Django form rendering.
- Categories in select do not match the model; remove invalid options like "Sepak Bola".
- Hover effects need improvement as per user feedback.
- JavaScript errors reported but appear to be false positives; script unchanged.
